## 🚀 Design-to-Code Automation Toolkit

This project is a fully free, semi-automated **UX-to-UI delivery pipeline**, built to streamline the journey from Figma design to production-ready React components. It integrates **Figma Tokens**, **Figma API**, **Tailwind CSS**, **CVA**, and **AI-powered generation** — all wrapped with **GitHub Actions** and **Chromatic** for continuous UI testing.

### ✨ Key Features

- 🧠 **Token Extraction**  
  Sync design decisions from Figma Tokens Studio and convert them into Tailwind-compatible utility classes.

- 🔍 **Figma Node Mapping**  
  Fetch raw component metadata from Figma API and intelligently map it to corresponding token rules.

- ⚙️ **AI-Driven Component Generator**  
  Use structured prompts to automatically scaffold `class-variance-authority` based React components.

- 📘 **AI-Generated Documentation**  
  Storybook `.stories.tsx` files are auto-created for every generated component, ready for designer-developer handoff.

- ✅ **CI & Visual Testing**  
  Every `git push` triggers GitHub Actions and Chromatic, providing automated UI validation and snapshot review.

### 📦 Tech Stack

- Figma Tokens Studio (Free)
